      <description>Heyoo!
As I finally find time to focus on things that I like, hobbies, and just life in general, I have also found time to revisit this area of the web. Today falls in 03-2024 and this is a brand-new introduction to my current state of existence ^_^
I have tried so many things! Shifted from being a beatboxer to a research assistant to working at a startup to starting up on my own and finally, to another exciting and very interesting place in life.</description>

      <description>Dada (Hindi for Grandad) Disciplined, a minimalist, extremely supportive, ever loving, the most reliable person ever, flexible and yet a maverick, a stubborn resilient fighter…all of these terms can only help in painting a snippet of what my grandad, dada, meant to me. However, the term I would choose over all these is companion. In fact, I would even argue that he was my companion more than anyone else’s towards the last few years of his life.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been feeling a little lonely. A little alone in this beautiful city called Bangalore. Down with viral, there&amp;rsquo;s not much that I can do apart from limited eating outside, limited physical activity, and limited social energy.
On any normal day, badminton would be my go-to activity. I would end up exercising, learning a new skill, socializing, and clearing my thoughts. All of these are extremely important needs that I need to give time to whenever and wherever to function productively.</description>

      <description>Hello there&amp;hellip;
As this world become crazier, messier, and increasingly distant, I have decided to find and establish my place in it through this website. It took me a while to finally work a little and create a home for my digital self but thanks to Hugo, someone has a new place for themselves that they might grow to like and call home.
My journey to where I am on 2022-09-25 has been a fun yet tortuous branch of your typical Indian upper middle class trajectory.</description>
