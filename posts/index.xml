      <description>Hello there&amp;hellip;
As this world become crazier, messier, and increasingly distant, I have decided to find and establish my place in it through this website. It took me a while to finally work a little and create a home for my digital self but thanks to Hugo, someone has a new place for themselves that they might grow to like and call home.
My journey to where I am on 2022-09-25 has been a fun yet tortuous branch of your typical Indian upper middle class trajectory.</description>
